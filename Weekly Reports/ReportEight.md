      worked on styling.
    - Back-end: Finished refining code based on given feedback and tested our APIs.

#### Individual Reports

- ##### Eva Liu:
    - Goals from last week: Finish developing front end's test suite and add stretch goals if
      possible.
    - Progress and Issues: I finished implementing request responses for dog requests. I developed
      part of the front-end test suite. I also fixed the styling for the web-app.
      necessary information from the database (mid) but ultimately figured it out. I wasn't stuck on anything.

- ##### Anish Konanki:
    - Goals from last week: Work on refining any code in time for the final release, and finish
      writing JUnit tests for my APIs.
    - Progress and Issues: Finished refining the code based on feedback given. Worked on testing, but setting up tests for
      the backend proved to be complicated. I worked with Steve to figure out what was going wrong (it was Java), and tried setting up the test.

- ##### Wenxuan Liu:
    - Goals from last week: Test&fix everything
    - Progress and Issues: Edit the navigation on the front end that allow users navigate through the app using buttons
      Helped to fix new dogs and other components for deployment preparation. Deploy our app every time new features are added.
      Record demo with eva. Attempted to write tests for find the dogs does not work yet.
      
- ##### Steve Ma:
  - Goals from last week: Make final adjustements for final release and work on writing JUnit tests.
                                       Check in with the team on any bug reports and also make changes based on
                                       peer review results.
  - Progress and Issues: I figured out how to write backend testing for the spark server framework. However, the test
                            is not working for everyone and I helped trouble shoot the issue and narrowed the issue down to
                            Java related. I also adjusted our docs based on the feedback provided and improved the developer 
                            doc and user guide.
- ##### An Nguyen    
  -Goals from last week: Ensure dog list in owner profile is updated after creating dog object.
  Prepare for final release. 
  -Progress and issue: Wrote tests for ViewDogProfile and CreateDogProfile. Help with the final release 
  slides and videos. Reviewed the code and adjusted based on peer view's feedback
