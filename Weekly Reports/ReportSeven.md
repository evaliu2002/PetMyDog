#### Individual Reports

- ##### Eva Liu:
  - Goals from last week: Finish implementing dog requests component and developing front end's
    test suite. I also plan on implementing more tests to develop front end's test suite.
  - Progress and Issues: I finished implementing request responses for dog requests. I also am working on
    developing more of the test suite for front-end. I had a bit of trouble grabbing and utilizing the 
    necessary information from the database (mid) but ultimately figured it out. I wasn't stuck on anything.

    possible.
