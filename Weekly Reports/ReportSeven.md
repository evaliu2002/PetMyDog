#### Individual Reports

- ##### Eva Liu:
  - Goals from last week: Finish implementing dog requests component and developing front end's
    test suite. I also plan on implementing more tests to develop front end's test suite.
  - Progress and Issues: I finished implementing request responses for dog requests. I also am working on
    developing more of the test suite for front-end. I had a bit of trouble grabbing and utilizing the 
    necessary information from the database (mid) but ultimately figured it out. I wasn't stuck on anything.
  - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Finish developing front end's test suite and add stretch goals if
    possible.

- ##### Anish Konanki:
  - Goals from last week: Work on refining APIs based on feedback and test them thoroughly.
  - Progress and Issues: I finished refining the old APIs and updated the backend code based on feedback
                         so that frontend can work more efficiently now. I also talked with the other devs
                         to figure out communication between frontend and backend to make createDogProfile
                         work properly. I'm currently figuring out how to write proper JUnit tests for my APIs,
                         but I have been testing my APIs and making sure they work as intended, or fix any issues.
  - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Work on refining any code in time for the final release, and finish
                                       writing JUnit tests for my APIs.

- ##### Wenxuan Liu:
    - Goals from last week: Finish /theOtherUserLocation: make a new endpoint that will return the sender’s
                            location to the receiver or return the receiver’s location to the sender.
    - Progress and Issues: Finished and tested /theOtherUserLocation. Finished navigation for user and navigation
                            for owner, now having trouble with displaying the path. Reconfigured front-end code to
                            have environment variable. Reconfigured backend code for easier deployment process. 
                            Set up all GCP related resources and deployed the app.
    - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Test&fix everything.


- ##### Steve Ma:
  - Goals from last week: Completed modifying the Meetup APIs to meet new frontend requirements.
  - Progress and Issues: I worked on updating the old APIs based on feedback from the team, I explored how to write
                         tests for my backend APIs and I'm currently working towards it. I also worked with Wenxuan
                         on clarifying how to update Meetup APIs and how necessary it is to return ther User IDs when
                         a request has been updated.
  - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Make final adjustements for final release and work on writing JUnit tests.
                                       Check in with the team on any bug reports and also make changes based on
                                       peer review results.
