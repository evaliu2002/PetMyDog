#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu: 
     - Goals from last week: Figure out how we are going to navigate between pages in the web app. 
                             Finish implementing the login and signup page for the web app.
     - Progress and Issues: I finished implementing the login component. I also finished set up Jest and
                            CircleCI testing for the front-end. I set up react-router for our web app
                            pages. I had a few issues when setting up react router and got stuck with
                            a few bugs but managed to fix the bugs after talking to the other front end
                            developers. I didn't get stuck for anything this week, just a few issues that
                            were eventually fixed.
     - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: My goal for the next week is finishing implementing all the
                                          necessary components for the beta. I also plan on implementing
                                           more tests to develop front end's test suite.  

###### An Nguyen

     - Goals from last week:    Continue building other components.
                                Figure out and implement React Router to navigate between the pages.
     - What I did: I finished the ViewMyDog components. I changed the structure of ViewMyDog and 
                            CreateMyDog to React Hook's structure. I added UploadPhoto so now CreateMyDog
                            page allows uploading profile photo from the local memory and preview them. 
                            
     - What we plan to do: Build the remaining components and discuss the communication with back end.
