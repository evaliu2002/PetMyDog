    Goals from last week: 
    - Front-end: Come up with the components needed. Using ant design to look for UI components.
    - Back-end: Design database schema.
    - Front&Back: Discuss what request/response are sent between the front/back end. Figure out the platform we are hosting the web app.
  
    What we did:
    - Front-end: Created and finalized the prototype for our web app. Started creating necessary components.
    - Back-end: Set up Spark framework in the code base, discussed possible designs for database schema, listed all of the APIs required, communicated with front-end
    regarding request and response format, and discussed how to update user locations.

    What we plan to do:
    - Front-end: Create all necessary components and create the skeleton for the web app before we add functionality.
    - Back-end: Finalize database design on Thursday, setup GCE, Google Cloud SQL, and ElasticSearch.

#### Individual Reports

    - Goals from last week: Create the rest of the necessary components for the web app: profile component, dog profile component, map component, etc.
    
    - Progress and Issues: I worked on the front-end project file organization. I decided to organize the files so that there are sub folders in the components folder for each component rather than store them all together in the components folder. This works because we will need to create test files for each component and rearranging the files this way will make it more organized. I also finished the templates for my assigned components. I am currently working on implementing google login and Oauth with the other developers. I learned how to style component files and organize components. I am having trouble figuring out how to navigate between the implemented web pages. I researched about react router but it seems like I am unable to use react router with buttons and icons. So I am currently stuck on figuring out how navigation between web pages will work.
    
    - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Figure out how we are going to navigate between pages in the web app. Finish implementing the login and signup page for the web app.
