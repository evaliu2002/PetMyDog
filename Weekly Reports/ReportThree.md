#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu
    - Goals from last week: Create the rest of the necessary components for the web app: profile component, dog profile component, map component, etc.
    
    - Progress and Issues: I worked on the front-end project file organization. I decided to organize the files so that there are sub folders in the components folder for each component rather than store them all together in the components folder. This works because we will need to create test files for each component and rearranging the files this way will make it more organized. I also finished the templates for my assigned components. I am currently working on implementing google login and Oauth with the other developers. I learned how to style component files and organize components. I am having trouble figuring out how to navigate between the implemented web pages. I researched about react router but it seems like I am unable to use react router with buttons and icons. So I am currently stuck on figuring out how navigation between web pages will work.
    
    - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Figure out how we are going to navigate between pages in the web app. Finish implementing the login and signup page for the web app.
    
###### Steve Ma
    - Goals from last week: I will work with others to finalize DB design on Thursday and setup GCE, Google Cloud SQL, and ElasticSearch.
    
    - Progress and Issues: I worked with other developers to finalize the database design and worked on setting up Google Cloud SQL. I reviewed Wenxuan's code for setting up SQL connection and code for OAUTH and discussed possible changes to the login route. We also reviewed geolocation related designs and finalized different situations on when the location would be updated. I'm currently working on the get dog profile API.
    
    - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Finish get dog profile API and work with other developers to finish the update location API.
