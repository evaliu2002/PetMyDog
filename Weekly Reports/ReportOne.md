#### Team Report: Status Update and Project Meeting Agenda
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report
  
    What we did:
    - Everyone in our group selected their role. 
    We came up with what features we are going to implement.
    We decided on the toolset and programming languages we are using for the project. 
    We also discussed the milestones and potential risks in our project.

    What we plan to do:
    - Front-end: come up with the components needed. Using ant design to look for UI components.
    - Back-end: Design database schema.
    - Front&Back: Discuss what request/response are sent between the front/back end. Figure out the platform we are hosting the web app.

#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - I refreshed my knowledge about front end development by looking through
    old repos which helped remind me of project structures I've used before. 
    I learned about different code base structures. I had trouble figuring out 
    a specific plan for the project since I only had a general idea of the project 
    and my role. I wasn't particularly stuck with anything.
    
    - I plan on reviewing more front end development materials to refresh my 
    memory. I also plan on working with the other front end developers 
    to create components for our web app.

##### Wenxuan Liu
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - After we discussed about project toolset, I read through a project I did in CSE331. 
    That project uses SparkJava and React, which is similar to the general structure of our project.
    
    - I find out I forget a lot of React, so I will focus on refresh my React skills.
    I will also complete tasks in frond/back end that we aim to finish.

##### Kevin Kong
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - I reviewed Spark Java framework slides from CSE 331, which we
    would use for backend API.
    
    - I will review my CSE 331 project and investigate how to use
    Spark Java together with GCE. I will also try to learn ElasticSearch,
    and how to use it to get geolocations.

###### Steve Ma
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report
    
    - Progress and issues
    
        - Finalized project proposal and the requirements of the project, discussed features with teammates and made adjustments according to requirements.
    
        - Finalized development plans and milestones.
    
        - Discussed with teammates the tools we will need to implement the application's main features. Decided to use Java as the 
    main backend language and JavaScript as the primary front-end language because everyone has some experience. 
    We also decided to use React for the front-end and the Spark framework for the backend.
    
        - Researched different packages and frameworks for handling geolocation information.
    
        - Researched different options for databases.
        
        - No immediate issues for now. Might need to figure out how to deploy the server but that's a later task.
        
    - Next week
    
        - I will continue to work with my teammates on the database design and request/response format. 
    My main priority right now is to understand the information needed for the main features so we can design a database schema 
    that would scale well for the applciation. We would also need to discuss the request and response format, 
    so front-end and back-end developers can work asynchronously without being blocked.

###### Anish Konanki
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - I reviewed the Spark framework info that we used in CSE 331 for the final project, and explored
    how it works and how we could use it for our backend. I also took a look at Compute Engine to see
    how we can use it for our project.

    - I will learn more about the Spark framework, and how we can integrate it with Compute Engine,
    and also discuss with my teammates about how we want to proceed with the structure for the backend.
