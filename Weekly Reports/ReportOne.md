    - TBD

#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - I refreshed my knowledge about front end development by looking through
    old repos which helped remind me of project structures I've used before. 
    I learned about different code base structures. I had trouble figuring out 
    a specific plan for the project since I only had a general idea of the project 
    and my role. I wasn't particularly stuck with anything.
    
    - I plan on reviewing more front end development materials to refresh my 
    memory. I also plan on working with the other front end developers 
    to create components for our web app.

##### Wenxuan Liu
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - After we discussed about project toolset, I read through a project I did in CSE311. 
    That project uses SparkJava and React, which is similar to the general structure of our project.
    
    - I find out I forget a lot of React, so I will focus on refresh my React skills.
    I will also complete tasks in frond/back end that we aim to finish.

##### Kevin Kong
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - I reviewed Spark Java framework slides from CSE 331, which we
    would use for backend API.
    
    - I will review my CSE 331 project and investigate how to use
    Spark Java together with GCE. I will also try to learn ElasticSearch,
    and how to use it to get geolocations.

###### An Nguyen
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report
    
    - I reviewed the previous projects from CSE 331 to prepare for using React and Javascript 
    in the current project. 

    - I will meet with other developers to define all the require components and start building 
    them. I hope to discuss what we can try to do to avoid the potential risks that we proposed.
