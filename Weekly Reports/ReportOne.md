    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report
    - I refreshed my knowledge about front end development by looking through
    old repos which helped remind me of project structures I've used before. 
    I learned about different code base structures. I had trouble figuring out 
    a specific plan for the project since I only had a general idea of the project 
    and my role. I wasn't particularly stuck with anything.
    - I plan on reviewing more front end development materials to refresh my 
    memory. I also plan on working with the other front end developers 
    to create components for our web app.
