#### Team Report: Status Update and Project Meeting Agenda
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report
    - Everyone in our group selected their role. 
    - We came up with what features we are going to implement.
    - We decided on the toolset and programming languages we are using for the project. 
    - We also discussed the milestones and potential risks in our project.

#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - I refreshed my knowledge about front end development by looking through
    old repos which helped remind me of project structures I've used before. 
    I learned about different code base structures. I had trouble figuring out 
    a specific plan for the project since I only had a general idea of the project 
    and my role. I wasn't particularly stuck with anything.
    
    - I plan on reviewing more front end development materials to refresh my 
    memory. I also plan on working with the other front end developers 
    to create components for our web app.

##### Wenxuan Liu
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - After we discussed about project toolset, I read through a project I did in CSE311. 
    That project uses SparkJava and React, which is similar to the general structure of our project.
    
    - I find out I forget a lot of React, so I will focus on refresh my React skills.
    I will also complete tasks in frond/back end that we aim to finish.

##### Kevin Kong
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report

    - I reviewed Spark Java framework slides from CSE 331, which we
    would use for backend API.
    
    - I will review my CSE 331 project and investigate how to use
    Spark Java together with GCE. I will also try to learn ElasticSearch,
    and how to use it to get geolocations.

###### An Nguyen
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report
    
    - I reviewed the previous projects from CSE 331 to prepare for using React and Javascript 
    in the current project. 

    - I will meet with other developers to define all the require components and start building 
    them. I hope to discuss what we can try to do to avoid the potential risks that we proposed.

###### Steve Ma
    - Goals from last week: N/A for this week's report
    
    - Progress and issues
    
        - Finalized project proposal and the requirements of the project, discussed features with teammates and made adjustments according to requirements.
    
        - Finalized development plans and milestones.
    
        - Discussed with teammates the tools we will need to implement the application's main features. Decided to use Java as the 
    main backend language and JavaScript as the primary front-end language because everyone has some experience. 
    We also decided to use React for the front-end and the Spark framework for the backend.
    
        - Researched different packages and frameworks for handling geolocation information.
    
        - Researched different options for databases.
        
        - No immediate issues for now. Might need to figure out how to deploy the server but that's a later task.
        
    - Next week
    
        - I will continue to work with my teammates on the database design and request/response format. 
    My main priority right now is to understand the information needed for the main features so we can design a database schema 
    that would scale well for the applciation. We would also need to discuss the request and response format, 
    so front-end and back-end developers can work asynchronously without being blocked.
