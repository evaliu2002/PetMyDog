#### Team Report: Status Update and Project Meeting Agenda
- Goals from last week:
    - Front-end: Finish implementing the rest of our listed components. Add more tests
      to develop our front end test suite.
    - Back-end: Finish implementing the remaining APIs for the beta release, and work on
      making an exhaustive test suite to make sure everything works well.
    - Front&Back: Develop and figure out communication and responses between the front end components
      and the APIs so that we're set up for the final release.

- What we did:
    - Front-end: Made progress on implementing requests from dog requests, create dog profile,
                 and view dog profile component. Started on the nav user and nav owner components.
    - Back-end: Implemented the remaining APIs (editUserProfile, editDogProfile, deleteDogProfile).
                Started working on refining APIs for more optimization and security.

#### Individual Reports

  - Goals from last week: My goal from last week is start making progress on the 
                                            meetup request component and the rest of the front end components.
                                            I also plan on implementing more tests to develop front end's test suite. 
  - Progress and Issues: I made progress on implementing requests from back end for dog requests. I did have a
                         few issues where back end had to modify their API for us to create seamless request
                         functionality. Our ideas for how the requests leading to navigation has changed several
                         times because everytime we realized we didn't consider something that should have been
                         considered. I didn't get stuck on anything this week, I am still waiting for back end to
                         modify the APIs so I can continue working on my front end component.
  - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Finish implementing dog requests component and developing front end's
                                       test suite.

  - Goals from last week: Complete the editDogProfile API for next week, start building an exhaustive test suite, 
                          and work on improving our old code based on given feedback.
  - Progress and Issues: I finished working on the editDogProfile API, and did some testing on my own to make sure it
                         it is working as intended. I also worked on the developer documentation for this week with Steve
                         and finished the backend portions of it. We also discussed potential improvements to the APIs.
  - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Work on refining APIs based on feedback and test them thoroughly.
