#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu:
     - Goals from last week: Finishing implementing all the necessary components for the beta. 
                             I also plan on implementing more tests to develop front end's test suite.  
     - Progress and Issues: Finished implementing find dogs and selected dog. There were a few issues during
                            the implementation, when we were stuck on changing how the routes worked.
                            I didn't get stuck for anything this week, just a few issues that
                            were eventually fixed.
     - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: My goal for the next week is start making progress on the 
                                          meetup request component and the rest of the front end components.
                                          I also plan on implementing more tests to develop front end's test suite.

###### An Nguyen:
    - Goals from last week:
    Build the remaining components and discuss the communication with back end.

    - Progress and Issues: Replaced the 'Choose File button' by a new button and implemented 'click on 
    current photo to upload new photo'.  Implemented a grid of cards to show the dogs in user's profile.
    Made the selected dog from find dog shown in a card format. Joined the presentation on the demo.

    - What we plan to do: Finish building 'owner-profile' and set up data fetching from the back end.
                        Make the map zoom out to a larger area when finding user's location


##### Kevin Kong
    - Goals from last week: Continue to work on backend API calls. Write documentation.

    - Progress and Issues: I implemented backend API. I also improved the README for backend.
                            I also helped with the demo and beta release. I did not get to write
                            documentations yet.

    - Plans and Goals for the next week: I will write documentations. I can also add more tests
                                        for backend. I will also work with others on coding and
                                        debugging.

###### Anish Konanki
     - Goals from last week: Finish the big APIs for next week and set up for the beta release, and
                            implement proper testing for the backend.
     - Progress and Issues: I worked on the endMeetup and requestMeetup APIs and worked on refining and testing them 
                            along with Steve. I also worked on writing up the README for building and testing the backend.
                            I also recorded 3 slides of the presentation along with An for the reflection part of the presentation.
     - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Complete the editDogProfile API for next week, start building an exhaustive test suite,
                                          and work on improving our old code based on given feedback.

###### Steve Ma
     - Goals from last week: Finish the APIs planned for next week, and figure out testing with the Spark Java server.
     - Progress and Issues: I developed the three meetup APIs for 1) requesting meetup, 2) accepting meetup, and
                            3) rejecting meetup. I worked with Anish on polishing those APIs and completed some
                            extensive testing on those APIs. We also figured out the workflow for when a user can make a
                            a request and wrote the SQL query for the conditions. We also had our beta release
                            and I recorded two of the slides of our presentation.
     - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Complete the edit user profile feature and revise our beta release based on 
                                          the feedback we have released.  

###### Wenxuan Liu
    - Goals from last week: Finish findDogs component and updateLocation, getNearbyUser endpoints.
    - Progress and Issues: Finished findDogs component with other developers. Finished updateLocation, getNearbyUser endpoints.
                            Added dependencies to package backend code. Deployed backend code to server. Built front endcode
                            and use server to serve static files. Bought a domain name and configured DNS service to redirect to
                            server public ip. Current issue is chrome and other modern browsers refuse to provide geolocation to http
                            sites, so we need to use https to get exact location.
    - Plans and Goals for the Next Week: Make server run in https, put together front end with a few more endpoints.
