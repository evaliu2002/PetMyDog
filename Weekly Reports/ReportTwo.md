#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu
    - Goals from last week: I planned on reviewing more front end development materials to refresh my 
    memory. I also planned on working with the other front end developers 
    to create components for our web app.
    
    - I finalized the web app prototype with the other front-end developers and we communicated through Slack about the prototype progress. I  created the react app for our web app and started creating the login component. I also worked on project file organization with the other developers. I learned that our file organization were best put into one whole file and then divide the front-end and back-end through sub directories. I had trouble figuring out design decisions for the prototype but solved it by talking to the other front-end developers and gaining inspiration from their ideas. I am currently a bit stuck on how information will be passed between front-end and back-end but will speak with everyone else to solve my concerns.
    
    - My plans and goals for the next week is to create the rest of the necessary components for the web app: profile component, dog profile component, map component, etc. 

###### An Nguyen

    - Goals from last week: I planned on review more Javascript and React material. I planned
    to design the build the prototype.

    - I completed the prototypes with the help of another front end developer using Figma

    - My plans for next week is to code the components that I planned and draft 
    out what we need to send to and receive from the back end.
