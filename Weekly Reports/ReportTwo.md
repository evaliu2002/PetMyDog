#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu
    - Goals from last week: I planned on reviewing more front end development materials to refresh my 
    memory. I also planned on working with the other front end developers 
    to create components for our web app.
    
    - I finalized the web app prototype with the other front-end developers and we communicated through Slack about the prototype progress. I  created the react app for our web app and started creating the login component. I also worked on project file organization with the other developers. I learned that our file organization were best put into one whole file and then divide the front-end and back-end through sub directories. I had trouble figuring out design decisions for the prototype but solved it by talking to the other front-end developers and gaining inspiration from their ideas. I am currently a bit stuck on how information will be passed between front-end and back-end but will speak with everyone else to solve my concerns.
    
    - My plans and goals for the next week is to create the rest of the necessary components for the web app: profile component, dog profile component, map component, etc. 

###### Anish Konanki
    - Goals from last week: I will learn more about the Spark framework, and how we can integrate it with Compute Engine,
    and also discuss with my teammates about how we want to proceed with the structure for the backend.

    - I worked with other back-end developers to figure out how to set up and use the Spark framework and Maven. I reviewed
    how we can use Spark to communicate with the front-end. I also discussed the back-end structure with the others. I still
    need to look at how we can use Compute Engine for the back-end, and also look at how to set up our database.

    - I will research more about Compute Engine and the database that we will use, and learn more about how to set up the database.
