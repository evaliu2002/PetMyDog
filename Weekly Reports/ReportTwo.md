#### Team Report: Status Update and Project Meeting Agenda
    Goals from last week: 
    - Front-end: Come up with the components needed. Using ant design to look for UI components.
    - Back-end: Design database schema.
    - Front&Back: Discuss what request/response are sent between the front/back end. Figure out the platform we are hosting the web app.
  
    What we did:
    - Front-end: Created and finalized the prototype for our web app. Started creating necessary components.
    - Back-end: Set up Spark framework in the code base, discussed possible designs for database schema, listed all of the APIs required, communicated with front-end
    regarding request and response format, and discussed how to update user locations.

    What we plan to do:
    - Front-end: Create all necessary components and create the skeleton for the web app before we add functionality.
    - Back-end: Finalize database design on Thursday, setup GCE, Google Cloud SQL, and ElasticSearch.
    - Front&Back: Finalize response/request formats and the list of APIs.

#### Individual Reports

###### Eva Liu
    - Goals from last week: I planned on reviewing more front end development materials to refresh my 
    memory. I also planned on working with the other front end developers 
    to create components for our web app.
    
    - I finalized the web app prototype with the other front-end developers and we communicated through Slack about the prototype progress. I  created the react app for our web app and started creating the login component. I also worked on project file organization with the other developers. I learned that our file organization were best put into one whole file and then divide the front-end and back-end through sub directories. I had trouble figuring out design decisions for the prototype but solved it by talking to the other front-end developers and gaining inspiration from their ideas. I am currently a bit stuck on how information will be passed between front-end and back-end but will speak with everyone else to solve my concerns.
    
    - My plans and goals for the next week is to create the rest of the necessary components for the web app: profile component, dog profile component, map component, etc. 
    
###### Kevin Kong
    - Goals from last week: Review my CSE 331 project and investigate how to use
    Spark Java together with GCE. Try to learn ElasticSearch, and how to use it 
    to get geolocations.
    
    - I setup the dev environment for Maven and Spark. I also helped reorganizing
    the structure of the directory.
    
    - For next week, I plan to settle with the team on the relational database,
    and figure out how to setup the database in the repo or dev environment.

###### An Nguyen

    - Goals from last week: I planned on review more Javascript and React material. I planned
    to design the build the prototype.

    - I completed the prototypes with the help of another front end developer using Figma

    - My plans for next week is to code the components that I planned and draft 
    out what we need to send to and receive from the back end.


###### Anish Konanki
    - Goals from last week: I will learn more about the Spark framework, and how we can integrate it with Compute Engine,
    and also discuss with my teammates about how we want to proceed with the structure for the backend.

    - I worked with other back-end developers to figure out how to set up and use the Spark framework and Maven. I reviewed
    how we can use Spark to communicate with the front-end. I also discussed the back-end structure with the others. I still
    need to look at how we can use Compute Engine for the back-end, and also look at how to set up our database.

    - I will research more about Compute Engine and the database that we will use, and learn more about how to set up the database.
    
###### Steve Ma
    - Goals from last week: I will continue to work with my teammates on the database design and request/response format. 
    My main priority right now is to understand the information needed for the main features so we can design a database schema 
    that would scale well for the applciation. We would also need to discuss the request and response format, 
    so front-end and back-end developers can work asynchronously without being blocked.
    
    - Worked with front-end developers to finalize the list of APIs required.
    - Lead the discussion on how user locations can be updated.
    - Discussed possible database designs and how to have our database work with ElasticSearch.
    - Setup Spark framework and Maven.
    - Assisted other developers to setup Git.
    
    - I will work with others to finalize DB design on Thursday and setup GCE, Google Cloud SQL, and ElasticSearch.

###### Wenxuan Liu
    - Goals from last week: I find out I forget a lot of React, so I will focus on refresh my React skills.
    I will also complete tasks in frond/back end that we aim to finish.
    
    - Worked with backend teammates to create a list of APIs that we will implement in the futrue.
    - Studied Spark framework that we are going to use.
    - Helped with set up project repo and structure.
    
    - I will discuss with backend team to finalize DB design on Thursday and create a database after that.
    - I will work with others to set up GCE and ElasticSearch.
    - I will study more about Spark framework and ElasticSearch.
