# PetMyDog

## Project Idea/Goal

Pet My Dog will be a web app that allows dog owners to broadcast their location while
walking their dogs, during which other nearby users of the app can locate owners in real time
and follow them to pet their dogs. In addition to broadcasting their location, owners can also
share small amounts of information about themselves and their dogs to nearby users.

Some main features we will implement include user registration, dog profiles, retrieving nearby
pets in map and list view, requesting and accepting meetups with nearby dogs, and searching for
pets by name. Some stretch goals we could implement include calling and messaging between users,
invitation system for meetups, a like system for owners and petters for safety precautions, filtering
system, and redirection to other social media platforms (e.g., instagram, facebook).

## Layout of the repository

All of the code will be contained in the main directory. The main directory is divided into front
and back end code, each in a sub directory. We will have our weekly reports in the Weekly Reports
directory, which we will update every week to report our progress and action items.

## Setup Instructions

Navigate to main/front-end.
Run npm install.
