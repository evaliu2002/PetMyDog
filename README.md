# PetMyDog

## Project Idea/Goal

Pet My Dog will be a web app that allows dog owners to broadcast their location while
walking their dogs, during which other nearby users of the app can locate owners in real time
and follow them to pet their dogs. In addition to broadcasting their location, owners can also
share small amounts of information about themselves and their dogs to nearby users.
