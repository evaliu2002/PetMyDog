### Project Idea/Goal

Pet My Dog will be a web app that allows dog owners to broadcast their location while
walking their dogs, during which other nearby users of the app can locate owners in real time
and follow them to pet their dogs. In addition to broadcasting their location, owners can also
share small amounts of information about themselves and their dogs to nearby users.

Some main features we will implement include user registration, dog profiles, retrieving nearby
pets in map and list view, requesting and accepting meetups with nearby dogs, and searching for
pets by name. Some stretch goals we could implement include calling and messaging between users,
invitation system for meetups, a like system for owners and petters for safety precautions, filtering
system, and redirection to other social media platforms (e.g., instagram, facebook).

### Operational Use Case(s)

The user can now login/sign up using Google Login. Once the user logs in/signs up, the user is redirected
back to the login/sign up page where they can press the button to redirect their page to the find dogs
page. The find dogs page displays a map with a marker of the user's current location, a 500 meter circle
around the user's marker, and lists all the nearby dogs within 500 meters of the user's location. The
user can press the dog and is redirected to the selected dog page where information about the dog is displayed.
